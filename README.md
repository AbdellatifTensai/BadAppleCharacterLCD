Bad Apple! but on a character LCD display

the resources expects a folder of the individual frames of the orginial bad apple video on 21 fps with a threshold of 40% at 16 * 20 pixels resolution, could use ffmpeg for that, and also the jSSC library to send the data through serial.

this is what it looks like! : https://youtu.be/P7mp5lpRF_A

i'm actully quite proud of how it turned out :P
